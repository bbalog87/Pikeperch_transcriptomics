# Pikeperch Transcriptome Sequencing and Analysis

This repository contains all scripts and relevant resources to perform multi-tissue transcriptome assembly,tissue expression atlas, co-expression and positive selction analyses in pikeperch (*Sander lucioperca*).

## Overview
Tisssue samples were collected from eight adult pikeperch individuals (3 males, 5 females). For each individual, different tissues including gonads (testis or ovary), liver, spleen, muscle, gills, brain, head kidney, skin, and heart were sampled and anaylzed by RNA-Seq.
